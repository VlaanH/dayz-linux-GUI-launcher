## Install DayZ

[Support for BattlEye anti-cheat for Proton on Linux has been officially announced by Valve on 2021-12-03.][battleye-announcement]

In order to get the game running on Linux, you first have to install the Steam beta client (see Steam's settings menu). Then install `Proton Experimental` and the `Proton BattlEye Runtime` (filter by "tools" in your games library). After that, set the "Steam play compatibility tool" for DayZ to "Proton Experimental" (right-click the game and go to properties).

### Important notes

In order for the game to actually run on Linux via Proton, the [`vm.max_map_count`][vm.max_map_count] kernel parameter needs to be increased, because otherwise the game will freeze while loading the main menu or after playing for a couple of minutes. Some custom kernels like TK-Glitch for example already increase this value from its [default value of `64*1024-6`][vm.max_map_count-default] to [`512*1024`][tkg-kernel-patch], but even this won't work reliably. Increasing it to `1024*1024` seems to work.

```sh
​sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=1048576
```

Or apply it permanently:

```sh
​echo 'vm.max_map_count=1048576' | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/vm.max_map_count.conf
```
